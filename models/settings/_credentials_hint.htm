<strong>Credentials / Service Account</strong>
<p>
    In order to access a Firebase project and its related services using a
    server SDK, requests must be authenticated. For server-to-server
    communication this is done with a Service Account.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't already have generated a Service Account, you can do so by
    following the instructions from the official documentation pages at
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk" target="_blank">
        https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Once you have downloaded the Service Account JSON file, you can use it
    to configure the package.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't provide credentials, the Firebase Admin SDK will try to
    auto-discover them
</p>
<ul>
    <li>by checking the environment variable FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS</li>
    <li>by checking the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</li>
    <li>by trying to find Google's well known file</li>
    <li>by checking if the application is running on GCE/GCP</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If no credentials file can be found, an exception will be thrown the
    first time you try to access a component of the Firebase Admin SDK.
